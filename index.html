      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure black-70 pb0 ph3-m ph4-l">
        Families make up the backbone of America, yet we fail as a nation to support those families who most need our help. It is unacceptable for our great nation to be one of a small handful of countries not to require paid parental leave. It is unfair that
        low income parents must spend such a high proportion of their income simply to pay for childcare. It is unconscionable that the current administration sees fit to rollback nutrional standards on the lunches we feed our children. Yet these
        are problems we can fix, if we send politicians to Washington who make the working class their priority.

      <h3 class="navy pb0 ph3-m ph4-l">Pullen for Parental Leave</h3>
      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure black-70 pb0 ph3-m ph4-l">
        Parental leave should be an expected right in a society that wants its families to thrive. Along with  New Guinea, Suriname, and a couple of island nations, the United States has the distinction of being one of the few countries that do not have national paid parental leave protections. Paid parental leave has been proven to lead to healthier children and stronger families. Providing the right to paid parental leave is an immediate method Congress could undertake to help better the lives of those they represent. This right will be one of my priorities if I am elected to serve the 1st District.

      <h3 class="navy pb0 ph3-m ph4-l">Pullen for Child Care Tax Credits</h3>
      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure black-70 pb0 ph3-m ph4-l">
        Child care tax credits are a common sense solution to the problem faced by working families in securing safe and nurturing childcare during working hours. Currently, low-income families can qualify for a tax credit to offset 35% of childcare expenses, but this percentage drops to 20% if you make $43,000 or more. As the typical family spends almost $12,000 per year in center-based childcare, this tax credit leaves too wide of a gulf for too many families. By being more generous towards our hardest working families, we can strengthen our communities and our country.

        In today’s technological age, post-secondary education is more important and more valuable than at any time in our nation’s history. Yet, as a Country, we are not pursuing the common sense reforms that will help the youth of today become the innovators, skilled workers, and entrepreneurs that we will need for tomorrow. For too many young adults, college tuition, whether at a trade college or 2 or 4 year university, is unaffordable. For those students who make the plunge, they are too often burdened by before unseen levels of student loan debt. These issues, if left unaddressed, threaten to drag down our economy and the well-being of us all.

      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure black-70 pb0 ph3-m ph4-l">
         College tuition is more expensive today than at any point in our Nation’s history. This is a problem that Congress can and must address. There was a time in our Nation’s history when higher education was affordable to all who had the drive to learn. It was not considered too expensive for the government then, and we are willingly being deluded now if we accept that argument.  As your Congressman, I would champion the expansion of current Federal programs to ensure that all low-income children are provided with the opportunity to attend college to gain the skills necessary to make it in today’s ever changing job market.

      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure black-70 pb0 ph3-m ph4-l">
        Student loan reform is another common sense step we can take at the Federal level. When young adults are burdened with the high level of student debt we are seeing today, before they even begin their careers, the economic consequences are dire. This is common sense. If a student graduates with a mortgage worth of debt, of course their ability to contribute to the economy as consumers is lowered. Imagine, if you will, just how much stronger our economy would be today if our millions of debt-ridden students were free to spend that money in their communities, creating jobs and supporting local businesses.

      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure black-70 pb0 ph3-m ph4-l">
        Our society is one that indefensibly creates double standards for men and women.  Women are objectified, harassed, and face gender-based violence on a daily basis. The Federal government has a duty to ensure that all citizens, regardless of gender, are treated equally. Yet under the current administration, the rights of women to self-autonomy have faced unprecedented attack. From Congress’s proposed ban on funding for Planned Parenthood, to State legislatures attempting to unconstitutionally roll back pro-choice protections, Republican ideology is clearly getting in the way of protecting women’s health and furthering gender equality.

      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure black-70 pb0 ph3-m ph4-l pb7-l">
        Planned Parenthood currently receives $555 million in federal subsidies per year to provide health services to women in need across the country, yet Congressional Republicans wants to take away this necessary funding. Let us be clear, Planned Parenthood is not primarily an abortion provider. In fact, Planned Parenthood and other public health organizations have been restricted from utilizing federal funding to provide abortions since 1976. Not a single dollar of your federal tax money goes to help provide abortions. In reality, Planned Parenthood is a nationwide organization that helps low income women maintain their health.
